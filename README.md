# Remove-Internal-Links
Ultra-lightweight and secure plugin to automatically delete ALL internal links from WordPress posts or pages. It quickly gets the job done by using PHP only - with 1 click of a button.

This plugin is ideal for people who want to start over their interlinking process (after messing up).

You can skip removing your cloaked affiliate links.

On my Cloudways Linode (1 core/1GB RAM) 171 posts are done within 7 seconds on the Fast speed setting.

The installed plugin is found under Settings / Remove Links.
